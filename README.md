#Drunkard 

Drunkard (Russian: Пьяница) is a variation of a simple card game, also known as 'Battle' or 'War', or 'Tod und Leben' in German.


## Game rules

The shuffle of 36 cards is dealt into two hands. 
A top card is revealed from each hand, and the hand with higher rank takes both cards, adding them to the bottom
of the winning hand's deck. One exception is that Six (lowest rank) takes Ace (higher rank).
Suites are ignored. 

If both revealed cards are of the same rank, they are 'contested' and stay on table.
New top cards are opened from the hands' decks and the winner takes all contested cards.
The hand running out of card loses the game.

## Implementation

This is an implementation of Drunkard game simulation.

Provided that the 'taken' cards are returned to the hand's deck in non-random order, the outcome
of the game depends on the initial shuffle only.
